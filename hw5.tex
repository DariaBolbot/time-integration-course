Come prepared to present your solutions on Monday, September 18th.

\begin{enumerate}

    \item Consider the centered, 4th-order finite-difference semi-discretization 
            of the heat equation (using $u_{i-2}$ through $u_{i+2}$; you can look
            it up or work out the coefficients yourself).  Is this semi-discretization
            positive?

            Implement the method (either directly via finite differences or using
            the FFT) and test it for $0 \le x \le 1$ with homogeneous dirichlet
            boundary conditions and the following initial conditions:

            \begin{enumerate}
                \item \begin{align*} x & = 1 + \sin(\pi x) \end{align*}
                \item \begin{align*} x & = \begin{cases} 1 & x<1/2 \\ 0 & x > 1/2 \end{cases} \end{align*}
                \item \begin{align*} x & = 1/2 - |1/2 - x| \end{align*}
            \end{enumerate}

    \item Prove that no 2nd-order finite difference semi-discretization for the advection equation
            is positive.  This is mostly done for you in H\&W, but you will need to understand it,
            write it in your own terms, and fill in the details.
\end{enumerate}
